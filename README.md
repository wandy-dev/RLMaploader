# Rocket League Map Loader

This is a plugin for the [SteamOS Plugin Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader) that aims to help Epic Games RL players load Steam workshop maps.

## Issues

No way to configure `rocketleague` or custom maps directories
May potentially delete the underpass map requiring you to verify the game files to get it back.
Only loads one map ATM due to this just being a proof of concept right now.

## Usage

TODO

## License

Undecided but leaving license from upstream for now.
